                        <description>Within the clutches of the forest live the satyr; a race of goat-like pranksters with a penchant for causing mischief. Originating from the xenohuman branch of the Hecate Project, they’re easily distinguishable from their cousins — the fauns — by their goatish horns, curly beards and highly unsettling bedroom eyes.\n\nSatyrs carry a conniving reputation amongst travellers. Though mainly harmless, they find great joy in engaging passers-by with riddles and tricks in the hopes of stealing a coin, a beer, or even a date. \n\nBut despite their lecherous ways, they can become fantastic diplomats and creatives. In fact, a satyr’s heartbeat is said to pound in a swing beat, as they connect with music on both a spiritual and biological level. This power grants them the potential to learn several unique musical abilities.</description>
