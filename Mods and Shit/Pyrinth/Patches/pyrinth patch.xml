                        <description>A warm, bright orange crystal. Rare and beautiful, its bizzare properties appear to originate from an ancient failed geological experiment. It glows and emits warmth innately which means it can be used to make torches or to heat up rooms.</description>

                        <description>A thin shard of pyrinth held into a metal hilt. The crystalline nature of the ore makes the sword sharper than any metal, and light to swing. The intense properties of the crystal also allow the blade to burn and sear flesh.</description>
