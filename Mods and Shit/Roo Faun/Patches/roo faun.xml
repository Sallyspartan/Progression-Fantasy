                        <description>Originating from the xenohuman branch of the Hecate Project, the skittish and mysterious fauns lurk in the greenest corners of the rim. Unlike their frisky cousins — the satyrs — fauns are a reclusive and bashful xenotype that are far more connected with nature than they are other with humanlikes. However, it is mechanoids which fauns abhor the most, freezing like a dear in headlights at the sight of such abominations.\n\nFauns are agile, fragile and reluctant to engage in conflict. However, their spiritual intertwinement with nature grants them unique defensive abilities, such as rising vines from the earth and releasing psychedelic spore clouds to obfuscate their foes. They can also boost the growth of plants around them.</description>

                        <descriptionShort>Within the mossy groves of various rimworlds live the fauns. A bio-engineered cross with deer DNA with an inate biological connection to nature. This connection imbues them with unique abilities and the power to increase plant growth, yet lumbers them with an uncontrollable fear of mechanoids.</descriptionShort>
